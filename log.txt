I divided the issue in some topics(questions) that I have to look for(answer):
-Where should I put the code about the calendar inside the project?   
-How can I add a service in the project?
-What privileges are needed to create events in a calendar?
-Where are this privileges  declared in the project? Or how the user grant this privileges? 
-What are the API calls to add events to a calendar ?
-Can a calendar be managed using only API calls?

@trining @issue86 @sub_tareas_research

I answered some of them

-Where should I put the code about the calendar inside the project?   

I should do it inside a service according to the documentation: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services

I tried it in a clean project an it works.

-How can I add a service in the project?

I tried to replicate the steps to include the service into the project, 
but I get this error when I try to inject the service into the controller: 
"Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: TestServiceProvider <- TestService <- WorkshopDialogController

" 
I tried to put the service within other module, and put that new module as a dependency of the main module "trainingApp" in the file "app.js", but the error remains. 

I tried to put the service within the "trainingApp" module, and I moved the file to the “util” directory where there are other service and the error remains. 

A asked for help and Tony told me that might be something about the grunt file. I havent read anything about it. 

After failing in the attempt to put the code of the example within a service I decided to put the code inside the controller just to make me sure that it works inside the project, but I got this error “Error: origin_mismatch”  
I didn't search anything about it because I had to leave.

@academy @phase2 @SOLID @polimorfismo

S ingle responsability principle (SRP)
O pen close principle (OCP)
L iskov substitution principle (LSP)
I nterface segregation principle (ISP)
D ependency inversion principle (DIP)

SRP  states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change. This means that you should design your classes so that each has a single purpose. This does not mean that each class should have only one method but that all of the members in the class are related to the class's primary function. Where a class has multiple responsibilities, these should be separated into new classes.

OCP  specifies that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. The "closed" part of the rule states that once a module has been developed and tested, the code should only be adjusted to correct bugs. The "open" part says that you should be able to extend existing code in order to introduce new functionality. As with the SRP, this principle reduces the risk of new errors being introduced by limiting changes to existing code.

LSP es el principio mas coplicado. Primero, este tiene que ver con la abstaraccion de los objetos. se supone que si utilizas un objeto o1 de una tal clase c1 y este hereda de otra clase c2 (clase padre), en el programa general donde se utiliza este objeto o1 se puede utilizar en los metodos como argumento objetos de la clase c2 (clase padre) gracias al **polimorfismo, sin que el funcionamiento del programa se altere. si es necesiario modificar el programa queire decir que la abstraccion ce c1 est aml echa, posiblemente no sea prudente que herede de c2. "model your classes based on behaviours not on properties". como vemos este principio regula la abstraccion de los objetos mas que el comportamiento/codificación del programa general.    

ISP  specifies that clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. This rule means that when one class depends upon another, the number of members in the interface that is visible to the dependent class should be minimised. That means you should separate the interface in two or more cohesive interfaces.

DIP  makes two statements. The first is that high level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions. The second part of the rule is that abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions. The DIP primarily relates to the concept of layering within applications, where lower level modules deal with very detailed functions and higher level modules use lower level classes to achieve larger tasks. The principle specifies that where dependencies exist between classes, they should be defined using abstractions, such as interfaces, rather than by referencing classes directly. This reduces fragility caused by changes in low level modules introducing bugs in the higher layers. 
Again thaks to polymorfism we can achiev this, because using am abstracction between the general calse and the low lebel class we can make taht que high level clase be reusable. example:

class lectura implemneta/hereda lectura
class escritura implementa/hereda escritura
class proceso 
class abstract_class/inteface lectura/escritura

class main instancia proceso, instancia lectura y escritura, manda lectura y escritura a la clase proceso a travez del constructor o con accesores.

dentr de la clase proceso tiene accesores que asignan el objeto de escritura y lectura a unavariable de tipo interfaz/claseabstracta lectura /escritura respectivamente (polimorfismo)

así si cambiamos de objetos de lectura escritura en el main, si estos heredan/implementan lectura/escritura el programa sigue. como se ve tien mucho que ver con lo de LSP. asi tanto la clase de altoo nivel y de bajo nivel son reutilizables.

**Polimorfismo: "El polimorfismo es una relajación del sistema de tipos, de tal manera que una referencia a una clase (atributo, parámetro o declaración local o elemento de un vector) acepta direcciones de objetos de dicha clase y de sus clases derivadas (hijas, nietas, …)." y "es hacer que un objeto se comporte como si fera de otro tipo" arriba se dieron varios ejemplos de polimorfismo en lso SOLID's principles. el polimosrfismo es util en los lenguajes fuertemente tipados.

@academy @phase2 @pullRequest @PR @solvedIssue @openSource

I found a Solved Issue https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/14289
in which the problem was the format trown by the filter "number", when you set the parameters 
gSize = 2,   // number of digits in each group of separated digits
lgSize = 3,  // number of digits in the last group of digits before the decimal separator 
in the locale file

that means that an enter like this 100000 should be 1,00,000 and an enter like 100 should be 100. in the first case it does it correctly but it fails in the second case. it trows 1,00. 

I made a test case firs. in the file "./angular.js/test/ng/filter/filtersSpec.js":

//test related to issue #14289

    it('should format according to different patterns', function() {

          pattern.gSize = 2;
          var num = formatNumber(100, pattern, ',', '.');
          expect(num).toBe('100');

        });
//end issue test

Then I modified the file "./angular.js/src/ng/filter/filters.js" 
within the function "function formatNumber(number, pattern, groupSep, decimalSep, fractionSize) {" there is a coment : 
// format the integer digits with grouping separators

beneth that the code was like this: 
    var groups = [];
    if (digits.length > pattern.lgSize) {
      groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.lgSize).join(''));
       
    }
    while (digits.length > pattern.gSize) {
          groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.gSize).join(''));
    }

    if (digits.length) {
      groups.unshift(digits.join(''));
    }


I moved the While inside the if blocke

    var groups = [];
    if (digits.length > pattern.lgSize) {
      groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.lgSize).join(''));
       
	while (digits.length > pattern.gSize) {
          groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.gSize).join(''));
    	}

    }
    
    if (digits.length) {
      groups.unshift(digits.join(''));
    }

Because when it was out side the if, the wile entered even when the lenght of the number wasen't larger than the number of the lgSize which states the first separation.

I checked the PR the solution was diferent but still good, it only chnage the if statement, instead of > it is >=.

Problem

When Sergeant Argus's army assembles for drilling, they stand in the shape of an N by N square grid, with exactly one soldier in each cell. Each soldier has a certain height.

Argus believes that it is important to keep an eye on all of his soldiers at all times. Since he likes to look at the grid from the upper left, he requires that:

    Within every row of the grid, the soldiers' heights must be in strictly increasing order, from left to right.
    Within every column of the grid, the soldiers' heights must be in strictly increasing order, from top to bottom. 

Although no two soldiers in the same row or column may have the same height, it is possible for multiple soldiers in the grid to have the same height.

Since soldiers sometimes train separately with their row or their column, Argus has asked you to make a report consisting of 2*N lists of the soldiers' heights: one representing each row (in left-to-right order) and column (in top-to-bottom order). As you surveyed the soldiers, you only had small pieces of paper to write on, so you wrote each list on a separate piece of paper. However, on your way back to your office, you were startled by a loud bugle blast and you dropped all of the pieces of paper, and the wind blew one away before you could recover it! The other pieces of paper are now in no particular order, and you can't even remember which lists represent rows and which represent columns, since you didn't write that down.

You know that Argus will make you do hundreds of push-ups if you give him an incomplete report. Can you figure out what the missing list is?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line with an integer N, followed by 2*N-1 lines of N integers each, representing the lists you have, as described in the statement. It is guaranteed that these lists represent all but one of the rows and columns from a valid grid, as described in the statement.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is a list of N integers in strictly increasing order, representing the missing list.
Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 50.
1 ≤ all heights ≤ 2500.
The integers on each line will be in strictly increasing order.
It is guaranteed that a unique valid answer exists.

2 ≤ N ≤ 10.

Case #1: 3 4 6

In the sample case, the arrangement must be either this:
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 5 6

or this:
1 2 3
2 3 5
3 4 6

In either case, the missing list is 3 4 6.


3) 
Problem

You are a teacher at the brand new Little Coders kindergarten. You have N kids in your class, and each one has a different student ID number from 1 through N. Every kid in your class has a single best friend forever (BFF), and you know who that BFF is for each kid. BFFs are not necessarily reciprocal -- that is, B being A's BFF does not imply that A is B's BFF.

Your lesson plan for tomorrow includes an activity in which the participants must sit in a circle. You want to make the activity as successful as possible by building the largest possible circle of kids such that each kid in the circle is sitting directly next to their BFF, either to the left or to the right. Any kids not in the circle will watch the activity without participating.

What is the greatest number of kids that can be in the circle?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer N, the total number of kids in the class. The second line of a test case contains N integers F1, F2, ..., FN, where Fi is the student ID number of the BFF of the kid with student ID i.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of kids in the group that can be arranged in a circle such that each kid in the circle is sitting next to his or her BFF.
Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ Fi ≤ N, for all i.
Fi ≠ i, for all i. (No kid is their own BFF.)
Small dataset

3 ≤ N ≤ 10.
Large dataset

3 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

Case #1: 4
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 3
Case #4: 6

In sample case #4, the largest possible circle seats the following kids in the following order: 7 9 3 10 4 1. (Any reflection or rotation of this circle would also work.) Note that the kid with student ID 1 is next to the kid with student ID 7, as required, because the list represents a circle.

@git @rebase @self_training

so far I've learnd the rebase concept. there is no rebas or marge. you certaly are going to merge, the question is if are youy going to regabe first.
Rebase is like lying a little, we re order the commits lo mek'em to look nicer. What it does is to coppy all the commist made in the topic branch and re doit on the maste rbranc (if you pionter it like that)  

there are "two" rebases, the "git rebase" and "git rebase -i"
as far I know both works for makeing the history of the commits cleanner, but in diferents ways. the interactive is used when you are ging to share the repo in github
for example. the normal rebase does the change in the history but the utility of this are two:

-making the histroy cleare
-making possible to execute te integration test in the topic branch, because of the nature of rebase, before we merge to master , the topic branch already have 
all the commits of master, becaus it place on the top of it.

example: we make 2 barnches form master: issue1 and issue2, it would lok something like this

|  issue1 
|/ issue2
|  master (head)


if we mearche isue 1 into master ussing --no-ff (it makes that the merge is done recurively) it would look like this
|  master, issue1
|\
|  comiits of issue1 
|/ 
|/ issue2

if we merged issue 2 like we did before it would looks like this

|  mater issue 2
|  \ 
|   \	
|  commit issue 1 merged into master issue 1
|\  /
|  comiits of issue1 
|//
|/ 
  
but id doesent look good and it says we worked in a branch wile we had another branch opened. so with git rebase master (with head in issue 2) and ten megring in master like this git marge --no-ff issue2 it will look like this

|  mater issue 2

@academy @phase3 @git @upstream @git_remotes @push_defaults

there is a directory called .git that is hiddn and it is the repo itself. It has a dir called object, which store among other files, one for te contet one for teh commit and on for the name of the file, One dir per file, and oe dir per commit, and also one dir per content, but if the contet is te same it is stored only once.
Git make the work compressing it and it does it well. but not so well with bin files.

there is also a file named config, wich is the configuration in the local level.

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
*[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/CarlosMiguelCuevas/gitUnderTheHood.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
**[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
***[branch "feature1"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/feature1

* this part was added when we add the remote with this command 
git remote add origin https://github.com/CarlosMiguelCuevas/gitUnderTheHood.git

it tell us that there is only one remote if we add more remotes git remote add new_remote https:...
there will be another remote section


** this section refres that the brach master has it's own default remote, if we type git push on master it will upload the changes to origin, in the branch master
to do this we typed the command :
	-git push -u origin master
at the biginig.
Because if we type git push origin master it would push teh changes to the master barnch in origin but the section abvobe wouldn't be created, and "git push" would throw an exception

**the command:
	-git push --set-upstream origin feature1
is another wey to create the brach section within the default remote and barnch to push wen execute the command git push on that branch


Git by default if you type git push it will try to push all the changest from all the branches to all the branches in the upstream.
to make that the git push only push the brancho we are at, we have to set the global config push.default to simple like this: 
	-git config --global push.default [simple|match]

@solve_problems @ubuntu @display_manager @gnome_unity

I decided to change the display manager from unity to gnom. I installed the gnom-shell and also the ubuntu-gnome-desktop

@Brightness @ubuntu_setup
I had trubles in the past seting the brightness up, but, now i found the solution very easy.
here: http://itsfoss.com/fix-brightness-ubuntu-1310/

just add a file called "20-intel.conf" at "/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/"

and within a wrote:

Section "Device"
        Identifier  "card0"
        Driver      "intel"
        Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
        BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
EndSection

and thas all

@Environment_variables @ubuntu_setup @$PATH

I learned that there are a lot of propts in lunux, depend on which are you using is the file wich is loaded. in the bash the .profile file is loaded. I use zsh wich is another comand Line, so it load the file .zshrc. it suposed that the file /etc/zsh/zshenv is used to load the environment variables, but it didnt wrk sfor me, I use the file ~/.zshrc to set the environment variables

@Git @Github @cherry-pick @stash @tags

I learned that in git we can use tags to mark release branches like v1.0.0 and we make this with: git tag -a "message" with out the -a is a simple tag and it doesent provide more info. we can checkut tags  and int make  a branch from that commit. we upload a tag to git by git push --tag

I also learned that stach is a command used to re-do changes to severla branches, it takes all of the files that ar not commited with the command: git stash. and with the command: git stash applay we can put those changes in the desired branch, but the changes saty in teh stack. with: git stash pop apllay the changes to the branch an also take them out of teh stack.

With the command: git cherry-pick {hash number of commit} we can re-do the commit in other branch, if we add the flag -n to teh command git cherry-pick -n 65372SDd we spesify that the changes don marge only stages.

@Git @Github @revert @commit --amend @reset @reflog

I learnd how to do and re-do and un-do thing with git:

Firs of al, there are two tipes of history in git, the public and the private, depend on which of them you are working with, is the method to undu thig you are going to use. the public history is the one you sahre with others, I mean when you push your commits to github, this commits that conform your history are public, so those commits are consider public history. The private history are the commits you havent share to other yet, I mean the comits that arent on github. 

*If you are dealing with public history you shuld only use revert, this is teh command: git reverse {hash of the commit}. what this command do is to create another commit doing exactly the oppsite things of the commit you entered in the command. This is a safe way to un du things, it is not clean but it is safe.
 
If you are working with private history there are more command that you can use: 

*firs the git commit --amend. This command do 2 things: it can fix the las commit you did, i mena the mesage you typed, if you make a typo, you can fix it with git commit --amend. Also if yo made a commit and then yo add mor changes ans you want them in the same commit, you only have to add them to the sage area en then use the git commit --amend.

*If you wnat to change another commit that is not the las one, you can not use git commit --amend, you can use git reset. with his command you indicate how many comits you wnat to work with lak this (3 in this example) git reset HEAD~3. An there are 3 type of resets: --hard, --soft, and --mixed(the default one) the --hard erese all the files hat were added in those commits and arrese all the chages made in this commits, like id haven exist. the --soft option makte all teh changes files or added to the sage area. and te default put them in the untracked area or marked like modified but not satged. git reset [--soft |--hard| {--mixed}] HEAD~1

*the is something called reflog, tha shows all the commits made, even the deleted ones with git reset. this is helpful to bring files from deth. it shows the hash to work with. but there are some rules: you have to be working in the same computer; the git trash colector shouldent be invoked explicitly; it has to be resently tant 30 days. knowing the hash yo can use git reset {#hascommit} but thsi birng the head to this int and if you have oter commits mad ther are erased. Other option is to use cherry-pick to select the commits you want to re do on the barnch you are working on or you can checkout the hash and tehn make a barnch from taht chekut an then make a merge or a rebase to include the changes to the master branch. just to recall the rebas is made like this. in the branch hat you want to re base git rebase master, to make it s base the top of master. the benefits of this si that the new barnch has all the features ans test of master ad yo can run teh tasets.

*finally the git rebase -i (intercative) it is used to change the comits, we can throw some comist, or we coan re name comits, but is commonly used to de squash before sharing the history to others using for exapme github. the command is the following: git rebase -i HEAD~3 (for work with 3 commits) and is shows up a menu with instructions. to do teh squash we mark wit r or

@academy @pahse3 @android @layouts @Hierarchy_Viewer

A layout is a frame to organize the elemnets of the view in a treee form. ther are four layouts: Linear (vertical and horizontal), relative, table, and frame.
The first one organize the elements in a column, onw benith the otehr; or in a row one next to each other. the relative let you to put the view in relation to the parten or siblings views. the table let you put the elements like in a table and the lastone let you put on elmeento infron the other.

the share some attributes: size, padding and margin, gravity: the firstone is the higth and the width, it can be match parent to ocupate the same space tahn teh parent, or wrapview to wrap the content of teh view; even you can set the size in dp (density-independent pixcels). The padding is the space from the border to the content of the view elemnt. margin is the space form the bordert o the parent. graviti is used to postion the elemnet, there are two of them: gravity and layout_garvity: the firstone is the position of the content inside the view and the second is teh posotion of teh view i relation to the parent.

The relative layout has a porperti call something like "if missing" that let us align the view to teh parent incase the view we are align to is not present. visiviliti = "gone"

The frame layout is useful for views that overlap one to eachother. It has a property called android:foreground="@drawable/" tha allow us to put the frame around the present frame.

The linear layout has an atribute weight, that letous share an space among some childviews, waht it does is that sums up all the values of weight and teh divided to the number of teh element and tas te space taht the childview desrve: exaple view1 ahs weight=1,  view2 has weight=2, so view1 will have 1/3 and teh second 2/3. if using 

The tableLayout us very useful, it behaves like a table in HTML. the elemets are placed inside <TbaleRow>. yo can use android:span to convine two cells and you can use android:column ti specify wher to put teh element those paaremters are inside the elemnt within the TableRow ettiquete. There are also the android:shrink, android:strech, collapsing, the fist one is used to make the table fit into the screen. you may asign the value "*" to make android decide teh spaces or you can set the specific column to mak taht column mor haight, and then te rest of teh elements of teh row you can asign teh height to "match_parent". The seconsd one is sued to make the table to fill the screen, if you set the specific column tat column will get mor space to fill te parent, if you set teh value "*" all the cellas will strech to fill te parent; yo can also specify which columns are teh onas to strech + "1,2,3". finally the thirdone is used to hide an specific column.  

there is a property called weightsum that is used to defin the sum of teh weigth, and that way yo can asign a fracton of space ti a single view.

Hierarchy viewer is a useful tool to see the tree of the views. here is teh github to us it:

@android @TextView @ImageView

I learned a cuple of things, first sp (scale independent pixels) is like do but for thext only becaus it is relative to the size set in the divice.
an mdpi = medium dencity device = 160pix/inches
an xxdpi = extra extra density device = 480pix/inches
butons recomendedt to 48 x 48 dp minimum.

about the text view, you dont have to set the textsice directly you can use :

android:textAppearance="?android:textAppearanceLarge" or small or medium to set the size but also the color. it is a pro tip

center != centerCorp in teh imageview. th centerCorp sacel the image to fit from border to border.

@android @Views @XML @xmlns

there is an atribute that we must place in the root view (View Group) called xmlns, its value is fixed, xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android".

xmlns means xml name space, it is used to identofy the attributes defined by android, this is because you can define your own atributes, thsi way we avoid conflicts. basicali this attribute allaw us to write the android: prefix in teh atributes, becasu is a shortcut to the url we place at the begining.

@android @Localice @Strings

Localice your app means make it adaptable to the setting or characteristics of your device. could be the language, the size or the density. Taltking about the language, you must make a file under the res->Strings directory called strings.xml, wich stores all the strings of the app in this format:

<resources>
	<string name="name_of_string"></string>
</resources>

when we what to call this string within the layouts.xml we use "@strings/name_of_string". when we call thsi resource within teh java file we do it like this: 
getString(R.string.name_of_string);
R.type_of_the_resource.neam_of_resource

one we get all the string within thi file we can create another file in teh same folder called strings-es.xml (es is for spanish) and within this file we place teh same strings but in spanich this way teh sistem takes the files that correspond with the configuration of teh system and we don hav to warry about the transaltion.

we can use the "Transaltor Editor" to make this file and set the ranslation os all the strings. we can open thsi tooll by right clicking the string file ans selecting the "Open the translator editor".

We should place some cometns in teh string files to tell the tarnsator how long the view is and tho pich teh correct transat of the word. this is the convetion:


if there is a string we dont want to translate we can use place holders inside the string tag, like this: 
<string name="name">Name: <xliff:g id="costumers_name" example="Carlos">%s</xliff:g></string>

the Xliff:g tag set a place holder, we must set an Id and we may set an expale of teh string inside in teh exaple this is use to place a name during execution, but we can use this to set simbols that don't need transaltion like the degree sibbol, we just write the unicode code for the degree simbol. 

we have to set the xml name space like this in the resorce tag:

xmlns:xliff="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2" 

wen we call the exaple string we do it a little bit different: 
getString(R.string.name,string_to_place_in_the_placeholder_example);

at last but not list we can use the 
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(string_to_format)
library to set the format of teh current currency, this is usefull becaus it set the simbols of the currency depneding of the settings of the phone, dollar, euro etc...
