I divided the issue in some topics(questions) that I have to look for(answer):
-Where should I put the code about the calendar inside the project?   
-How can I add a service in the project?
-What privileges are needed to create events in a calendar?
-Where are this privileges  declared in the project? Or how the user grant this privileges? 
-What are the API calls to add events to a calendar ?
-Can a calendar be managed using only API calls?

@trining @issue86 @sub_tareas_research

I answered some of them

-Where should I put the code about the calendar inside the project?   

I should do it inside a service according to the documentation: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services

I tried it in a clean project an it works.

-How can I add a service in the project?

I tried to replicate the steps to include the service into the project, 
but I get this error when I try to inject the service into the controller: 
"Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: TestServiceProvider <- TestService <- WorkshopDialogController

" 
I tried to put the service within other module, and put that new module as a dependency of the main module "trainingApp" in the file "app.js", but the error remains. 

I tried to put the service within the "trainingApp" module, and I moved the file to the “util” directory where there are other service and the error remains. 

A asked for help and Tony told me that might be something about the grunt file. I havent read anything about it. 

After failing in the attempt to put the code of the example within a service I decided to put the code inside the controller just to make me sure that it works inside the project, but I got this error “Error: origin_mismatch”  
I didn't search anything about it because I had to leave.

@academy @phase2 @SOLID @polimorfismo

S ingle responsability principle (SRP)
O pen close principle (OCP)
L iskov substitution principle (LSP)
I nterface segregation principle (ISP)
D ependency inversion principle (DIP)

SRP  states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change. This means that you should design your classes so that each has a single purpose. This does not mean that each class should have only one method but that all of the members in the class are related to the class's primary function. Where a class has multiple responsibilities, these should be separated into new classes.

OCP  specifies that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. The "closed" part of the rule states that once a module has been developed and tested, the code should only be adjusted to correct bugs. The "open" part says that you should be able to extend existing code in order to introduce new functionality. As with the SRP, this principle reduces the risk of new errors being introduced by limiting changes to existing code.

LSP es el principio mas coplicado. Primero, este tiene que ver con la abstaraccion de los objetos. se supone que si utilizas un objeto o1 de una tal clase c1 y este hereda de otra clase c2 (clase padre), en el programa general donde se utiliza este objeto o1 se puede utilizar en los metodos como argumento objetos de la clase c2 (clase padre) gracias al **polimorfismo, sin que el funcionamiento del programa se altere. si es necesiario modificar el programa queire decir que la abstraccion ce c1 est aml echa, posiblemente no sea prudente que herede de c2. "model your classes based on behaviours not on properties". como vemos este principio regula la abstraccion de los objetos mas que el comportamiento/codificación del programa general.    

ISP  specifies that clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. This rule means that when one class depends upon another, the number of members in the interface that is visible to the dependent class should be minimised. That means you should separate the interface in two or more cohesive interfaces.

DIP  makes two statements. The first is that high level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions. The second part of the rule is that abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions. The DIP primarily relates to the concept of layering within applications, where lower level modules deal with very detailed functions and higher level modules use lower level classes to achieve larger tasks. The principle specifies that where dependencies exist between classes, they should be defined using abstractions, such as interfaces, rather than by referencing classes directly. This reduces fragility caused by changes in low level modules introducing bugs in the higher layers. 
Again thaks to polymorfism we can achiev this, because using am abstracction between the general calse and the low lebel class we can make taht que high level clase be reusable. example:

class lectura implemneta/hereda lectura
class escritura implementa/hereda escritura
class proceso 
class abstract_class/inteface lectura/escritura

class main instancia proceso, instancia lectura y escritura, manda lectura y escritura a la clase proceso a travez del constructor o con accesores.

dentr de la clase proceso tiene accesores que asignan el objeto de escritura y lectura a unavariable de tipo interfaz/claseabstracta lectura /escritura respectivamente (polimorfismo)

así si cambiamos de objetos de lectura escritura en el main, si estos heredan/implementan lectura/escritura el programa sigue. como se ve tien mucho que ver con lo de LSP. asi tanto la clase de altoo nivel y de bajo nivel son reutilizables.

**Polimorfismo: "El polimorfismo es una relajación del sistema de tipos, de tal manera que una referencia a una clase (atributo, parámetro o declaración local o elemento de un vector) acepta direcciones de objetos de dicha clase y de sus clases derivadas (hijas, nietas, …)." y "es hacer que un objeto se comporte como si fera de otro tipo" arriba se dieron varios ejemplos de polimorfismo en lso SOLID's principles. el polimosrfismo es util en los lenguajes fuertemente tipados.

@academy @phase2 @pullRequest @PR @solvedIssue @openSource

I found a Solved Issue https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/14289
in which the problem was the format trown by the filter "number", when you set the parameters 
gSize = 2,   // number of digits in each group of separated digits
lgSize = 3,  // number of digits in the last group of digits before the decimal separator 
in the locale file

that means that an enter like this 100000 should be 1,00,000 and an enter like 100 should be 100. in the first case it does it correctly but it fails in the second case. it trows 1,00. 

I made a test case firs. in the file "./angular.js/test/ng/filter/filtersSpec.js":

//test related to issue #14289

    it('should format according to different patterns', function() {

          pattern.gSize = 2;
          var num = formatNumber(100, pattern, ',', '.');
          expect(num).toBe('100');

        });
//end issue test

Then I modified the file "./angular.js/src/ng/filter/filters.js" 
within the function "function formatNumber(number, pattern, groupSep, decimalSep, fractionSize) {" there is a coment : 
// format the integer digits with grouping separators

beneth that the code was like this: 
    var groups = [];
    if (digits.length > pattern.lgSize) {
      groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.lgSize).join(''));
       
    }
    while (digits.length > pattern.gSize) {
          groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.gSize).join(''));
    }

    if (digits.length) {
      groups.unshift(digits.join(''));
    }


I moved the While inside the if blocke

    var groups = [];
    if (digits.length > pattern.lgSize) {
      groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.lgSize).join(''));
       
	while (digits.length > pattern.gSize) {
          groups.unshift(digits.splice(-pattern.gSize).join(''));
    	}

    }
    
    if (digits.length) {
      groups.unshift(digits.join(''));
    }

Because when it was out side the if, the wile entered even when the lenght of the number wasen't larger than the number of the lgSize which states the first separation.

I checked the PR the solution was diferent but still good, it only chnage the if statement, instead of > it is >=.

Problem

When Sergeant Argus's army assembles for drilling, they stand in the shape of an N by N square grid, with exactly one soldier in each cell. Each soldier has a certain height.

Argus believes that it is important to keep an eye on all of his soldiers at all times. Since he likes to look at the grid from the upper left, he requires that:

    Within every row of the grid, the soldiers' heights must be in strictly increasing order, from left to right.
    Within every column of the grid, the soldiers' heights must be in strictly increasing order, from top to bottom. 

Although no two soldiers in the same row or column may have the same height, it is possible for multiple soldiers in the grid to have the same height.

Since soldiers sometimes train separately with their row or their column, Argus has asked you to make a report consisting of 2*N lists of the soldiers' heights: one representing each row (in left-to-right order) and column (in top-to-bottom order). As you surveyed the soldiers, you only had small pieces of paper to write on, so you wrote each list on a separate piece of paper. However, on your way back to your office, you were startled by a loud bugle blast and you dropped all of the pieces of paper, and the wind blew one away before you could recover it! The other pieces of paper are now in no particular order, and you can't even remember which lists represent rows and which represent columns, since you didn't write that down.

You know that Argus will make you do hundreds of push-ups if you give him an incomplete report. Can you figure out what the missing list is?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line with an integer N, followed by 2*N-1 lines of N integers each, representing the lists you have, as described in the statement. It is guaranteed that these lists represent all but one of the rows and columns from a valid grid, as described in the statement.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is a list of N integers in strictly increasing order, representing the missing list.
Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 50.
1 ≤ all heights ≤ 2500.
The integers on each line will be in strictly increasing order.
It is guaranteed that a unique valid answer exists.

2 ≤ N ≤ 10.

Case #1: 3 4 6

In the sample case, the arrangement must be either this:
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 5 6

or this:
1 2 3
2 3 5
3 4 6

In either case, the missing list is 3 4 6.


3) 
Problem

You are a teacher at the brand new Little Coders kindergarten. You have N kids in your class, and each one has a different student ID number from 1 through N. Every kid in your class has a single best friend forever (BFF), and you know who that BFF is for each kid. BFFs are not necessarily reciprocal -- that is, B being A's BFF does not imply that A is B's BFF.

Your lesson plan for tomorrow includes an activity in which the participants must sit in a circle. You want to make the activity as successful as possible by building the largest possible circle of kids such that each kid in the circle is sitting directly next to their BFF, either to the left or to the right. Any kids not in the circle will watch the activity without participating.

What is the greatest number of kids that can be in the circle?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer N, the total number of kids in the class. The second line of a test case contains N integers F1, F2, ..., FN, where Fi is the student ID number of the BFF of the kid with student ID i.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of kids in the group that can be arranged in a circle such that each kid in the circle is sitting next to his or her BFF.
Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ Fi ≤ N, for all i.
Fi ≠ i, for all i. (No kid is their own BFF.)
Small dataset

3 ≤ N ≤ 10.
Large dataset

3 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

Case #1: 4
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 3
Case #4: 6

In sample case #4, the largest possible circle seats the following kids in the following order: 7 9 3 10 4 1. (Any reflection or rotation of this circle would also work.) Note that the kid with student ID 1 is next to the kid with student ID 7, as required, because the list represents a circle.

@git @rebase @self_training

so far I've learnd the rebase concept. there is no rebas or marge. you certaly are going to merge, the question is if are youy going to regabe first.
Rebase is like lying a little, we re order the commits lo mek'em to look nicer. What it does is to coppy all the commist made in the topic branch and re doit on the maste rbranc (if you pionter it like that)  

there are "two" rebases, the "git rebase" and "git rebase -i"
as far I know both works for makeing the history of the commits cleanner, but in diferents ways. the interactive is used when you are ging to share the repo in github
for example. the normal rebase does the change in the history but the utility of this are two:

-making the histroy cleare
-making possible to execute te integration test in the topic branch, because of the nature of rebase, before we merge to master , the topic branch already have 
all the commits of master, becaus it place on the top of it.

example: we make 2 barnches form master: issue1 and issue2, it would lok something like this

|  issue1 
|/ issue2
|  master (head)


if we mearche isue 1 into master ussing --no-ff (it makes that the merge is done recurively) it would look like this
|  master, issue1
|\
|  comiits of issue1 
|/ 
|/ issue2

if we merged issue 2 like we did before it would looks like this

|  mater issue 2
|  \ 
|   \	
|  commit issue 1 merged into master issue 1
|\  /
|  comiits of issue1 
|//
|/ 
  
but id doesent look good and it says we worked in a branch wile we had another branch opened. so with git rebase master (with head in issue 2) and ten megring in master like this git marge --no-ff issue2 it will look like this

|  mater issue 2

@academy @phase3 @git @upstream @git_remotes @push_defaults

there is a directory called .git that is hiddn and it is the repo itself. It has a dir called object, which store among other files, one for te contet one for teh commit and on for the name of the file, One dir per file, and oe dir per commit, and also one dir per content, but if the contet is te same it is stored only once.
Git make the work compressing it and it does it well. but not so well with bin files.

there is also a file named config, wich is the configuration in the local level.

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
*[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/CarlosMiguelCuevas/gitUnderTheHood.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
**[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
***[branch "feature1"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/feature1

* this part was added when we add the remote with this command 
git remote add origin https://github.com/CarlosMiguelCuevas/gitUnderTheHood.git

it tell us that there is only one remote if we add more remotes git remote add new_remote https:...
there will be another remote section


** this section refres that the brach master has it's own default remote, if we type git push on master it will upload the changes to origin, in the branch master
to do this we typed the command :
	-git push -u origin master
at the biginig.
Because if we type git push origin master it would push teh changes to the master barnch in origin but the section abvobe wouldn't be created, and "git push" would throw an exception

**the command:
	-git push --set-upstream origin feature1
is another wey to create the brach section within the default remote and barnch to push wen execute the command git push on that branch


Git by default if you type git push it will try to push all the changest from all the branches to all the branches in the upstream.
to make that the git push only push the brancho we are at, we have to set the global config push.default to simple like this: 
	-git config --global push.default [simple|match]

@solve_problems @ubuntu @display_manager @gnome_unity

I decided to change the display manager from unity to gnom. I installed the gnom-shell and also the ubuntu-gnome-desktop
and the I run the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm and it showed a list to pick the desired manager and I picked gmd.... 
but it messed up, and at the end it did't isntall well, and it looked ugly so I uninstalled the shell and th egenome-desktop, but O had problems
I foun the solution here:

@Brightness @ubuntu_setup
I had trubles in the past seting the brightness up, but, now i found the solution very easy.
here: http://itsfoss.com/fix-brightness-ubuntu-1310/

just add a file called "20-intel.conf" at "/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/"

and within a wrote:

Section "Device"
        Identifier  "card0"
        Driver      "intel"
        Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
        BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"

@Environment_variables @ubuntu_setup @$PATH

I learned that there are a lot of propts in lunux, depend on which are you using is the file wich is loaded. in the bash the .profile file is loaded. I use zsh wich is another comand Line, so it load the file .zshrc. it suposed that the file /etc/zsh/zshenv is used to load the environment variables, but it didnt wrk sfor me, I use the file ~/.zshrc to set the environment variables

@Git @Github @cherry-pick @stash @tags

I learned that in git we can use tags to mark release branches like v1.0.0 and we make this with: git tag -a "message" with out the -a is a simple tag and it doesent provide more info. we can checkut tags  and int make  a branch from that commit. we upload a tag to git by git push --tag

I also learned that stach is a command used to re-do changes to severla branches, it takes all of the files that ar not commited with the command: git stash. and with the command: git stash applay we can put those changes in the desired branch, but the changes saty in teh stack. with: git stash pop apllay the changes to the branch an also take them out of teh stack.

With the command: git cherry-pick {hash number of commit} we can re-do the commit in other branch, if we add the flag -n to teh command git cherry-pick -n 65372SDd we spesify that the changes don marge only stages.

@Git @Github @revert @commit --amend @reset @reflog

I learnd how to do and re-do and un-do thing with git:

Firs of al, there are two tipes of history in git, the public and the private, depend on which of them you are working with, is the method to undu thig you are going to use. the public history is the one you sahre with others, I mean when you push your commits to github, this commits that conform your history are public, so those commits are consider public history. The private history are the commits you havent share to other yet, I mean the comits that arent on github. 

*If you are dealing with public history you shuld only use revert, this is teh command: git reverse {hash of the commit}. what this command do is to create another commit doing exactly the oppsite things of the commit you entered in the command. This is a safe way to un du things, it is not clean but it is safe.
 
If you are working with private history there are more command that you can use: 

*firs the git commit --amend. This command do 2 things: it can fix the las commit you did, i mena the mesage you typed, if you make a typo, you can fix it with git commit --amend. Also if yo made a commit and then yo add mor changes ans you want them in the same commit, you only have to add them to the sage area en then use the git commit --amend.

*If you wnat to change another commit that is not the las one, you can not use git commit --amend, you can use git reset. with his command you indicate how many comits you wnat to work with lak this (3 in this example) git reset HEAD~3. An there are 3 type of resets: --hard, --soft, and --mixed(the default one) the --hard erese all the files hat were added in those commits and arrese all the chages made in this commits, like id haven exist. the --soft option makte all teh changes files or added to the sage area. and te default put them in the untracked area or marked like modified but not satged. git reset [--soft |--hard| {--mixed}] HEAD~1

*the is something called reflog, tha shows all the commits made, even the deleted ones with git reset. this is helpful to bring files from deth. it shows the hash to work with. but there are some rules: you have to be working in the same computer; the git trash colector shouldent be invoked explicitly; it has to be resently tant 30 days. knowing the hash yo can use git reset {#hascommit} but thsi birng the head to this int and if you have oter commits mad ther are erased. Other option is to use cherry-pick to select the commits you want to re do on the barnch you are working on or you can checkout the hash and tehn make a barnch from taht chekut an then make a merge or a rebase to include the changes to the master branch. just to recall the rebas is made like this. in the branch hat you want to re base git rebase master, to make it s base the top of master. the benefits of this si that the new barnch has all the features ans test of master ad yo can run teh tasets.

*finally the git rebase -i (intercative) it is used to change the comits, we can throw some comist, or we coan re name comits, but is commonly used to de squash before sharing the history to others using for exapme github. the command is the following: git rebase -i HEAD~3 (for work with 3 commits) and is shows up a menu with instructions. to do teh squash we mark wit r or

@academy @pahse3 @android @layouts @Hierarchy_Viewer

A layout is a frame to organize the elemnets of the view in a treee form. ther are four layouts: Linear (vertical and horizontal), relative, table, and frame.
The first one organize the elements in a column, onw benith the otehr; or in a row one next to each other. the relative let you to put the view in relation to the parten or siblings views. the table let you put the elements like in a table and the lastone let you put on elmeento infron the other.

the share some attributes: size, padding and margin, gravity: the firstone is the higth and the width, it can be match parent to ocupate the same space tahn teh parent, or wrapview to wrap the content of teh view; even you can set the size in dp (density-independent pixcels). The padding is the space from the border to the content of the view elemnt. margin is the space form the bordert o the parent. graviti is used to postion the elemnet, there are two of them: gravity and layout_garvity: the firstone is the position of the content inside the view and the second is teh posotion of teh view i relation to the parent.

The relative layout has a porperti call something like "if missing" that let us align the view to teh parent incase the view we are align to is not present. visiviliti = "gone"

The frame layout is useful for views that overlap one to eachother. It has a property called android:foreground="@drawable/" tha allow us to put the frame around the present frame.

The linear layout has an atribute weight, that letous share an space among some childviews, waht it does is that sums up all the values of weight and teh divided to the number of teh element and tas te space taht the childview desrve: exaple view1 ahs weight=1,  view2 has weight=2, so view1 will have 1/3 and teh second 2/3. if using 

The tableLayout us very useful, it behaves like a table in HTML. the elemets are placed inside <TbaleRow>. yo can use android:span to convine two cells and you can use android:column ti specify wher to put teh element those paaremters are inside the elemnt within the TableRow ettiquete. There are also the android:shrink, android:strech, collapsing, the fist one is used to make the table fit into the screen. you may asign the value "*" to make android decide teh spaces or you can set the specific column to mak taht column mor haight, and then te rest of teh elements of teh row you can asign teh height to "match_parent". The seconsd one is sued to make the table to fill the screen, if you set the specific column tat column will get mor space to fill te parent, if you set teh value "*" all the cellas will strech to fill te parent; yo can also specify which columns are teh onas to strech + "1,2,3". finally the thirdone is used to hide an specific column.  

there is a property called weightsum that is used to defin the sum of teh weigth, and that way yo can asign a fracton of space ti a single view.

Hierarchy viewer is a useful tool to see the tree of the views. here is teh github to us it:

@android @TextView @ImageView

I learned a cuple of things, first sp (scale independent pixels) is like do but for thext only becaus it is relative to the size set in the divice.
an mdpi = medium dencity device = 160pix/inches
an xxdpi = extra extra density device = 480pix/inches
butons recomendedt to 48 x 48 dp minimum.

about the text view, you dont have to set the textsice directly you can use :

android:textAppearance="?android:textAppearanceLarge" or small or medium to set the size but also the color. it is a pro tip

center != centerCorp in teh imageview. th centerCorp sacel the image to fit from border to border.

//2016/05/16T19:38---------------------
@android @Views @XML @xmlns

there is an atribute that we must place in the root view (View Group) called xmlns, its value is fixed, xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android".

xmlns means xml name space, it is used to identofy the attributes defined by android, this is because you can define your own atributes, thsi way we avoid conflicts. basicali this attribute allaw us to write the android: prefix in teh atributes, becasu is a shortcut to the url we place at the begining.
 
--------------------------------------//
//2016/06/13T21:31---------------------
@android @Localice @Strings

Localice your app means make it adaptable to the setting or characteristics of your device. could be the language, the size or the density. Taltking about the language, you must make a file under the res->Strings directory called strings.xml, wich stores all the strings of the app in this format:

<resources>
	<string name="name_of_string"></string>
</resources>

when we what to call this string within the layouts.xml we use "@strings/name_of_string". when we call thsi resource within teh java file we do it like this: 
getString(R.string.name_of_string);
R.type_of_the_resource.neam_of_resource

one we get all the string within thi file we can create another file in teh same folder called strings-es.xml (es is for spanish) and within this file we place teh same strings but in spanich this way teh sistem takes the files that correspond with the configuration of teh system and we don hav to warry about the transaltion.

we can use the "Transaltor Editor" to make this file and set the ranslation os all the strings. we can open thsi tooll by right clicking the string file ans selecting the "Open the translator editor".

We should place some cometns in teh string files to tell the tarnsator how long the view is and tho pich teh correct transat of the word. this is the convetion:

<!-- coment about teh string [CHAR LIMIT=23]--> 23 is an example

if there is a string we dont want to translate we can use place holders inside the string tag, like this: 
<string name="name">Name: <xliff:g id="costumers_name" example="Carlos">%s</xliff:g></string>

the Xliff:g tag set a place holder, we must set an Id and we may set an expale of teh string inside in teh exaple this is use to place a name during execution, but we can use this to set simbols that don't need transaltion like the degree sibbol, we just write the unicode code for the degree simbol. 

we have to set the xml name space like this in the resorce tag:

xmlns:xliff="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2" 

wen we call the exaple string we do it a little bit different: 
getString(R.string.name,string_to_place_in_the_placeholder_example);

at last but not list we can use the 
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(string_to_format)
library to set the format of teh current currency, this is usefull becaus it set the simbols of the currency depneding of the settings of the phone, dollar, euro etc...

@android @Style @theme

I finished the course "android for bigginers", and at the end the showed us the use of the styles and teh themes.

yo can applay an style to a specific view, it is useful, because you can separete the color, and padding or whaterver you want from the view and store it in a separet file. and re use those settings to another view, that waty you can up date evre view from a singlearchive. to do this, you have to decalre in the file Style.xml, within the tag resource a tag style, you have to define a name for that style. whithin thouse tags you declare items like this:  <item name="android:layout_width" >wrap_content</item>
the name is the exact property for the view, and te content of teh tag is te value of the atribute. and to use that style un a view you call it lik this: 
style="@style/name_of_style", as easy as this.

In the other hand we have the Themes, this are declared in teh same file than the style, but this configuration i sapplied to the whole app, or a whole acctivity, that is set un the AndroidManifest.xml,  android:theme="@style/AppTheme" with this atribut in the activity tag or in teh aplication tag.
The android L broght with it the materials theams, theare are 3: 
@android:style/Theme.Material (dark version)
@android:style/Theme.Material.Light (light version)
@android:style/Theme.Material.Light.DarkActionBar

and in order to use it in older devices we have to use the compat version:
Theme.AppCompat.
Theme.AppCompat.Light
Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar

we set this in the parent aattribut of the style tag, this way we get all the config of those themes. and within the tags we overide the orpertis we like, like this:
	<item name="colorPrimary">@color/colorPrimary</item>
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/colorAccent</item>

this are 3 of teh main atribs to be modify, the firstone is the color of teh action bar. teh second is the color of teh state bar. and the third is te color of sertain views like checkboxes.

inthe examples we defined the Hex color in a file named color i  the res.values folder

this way all the app has teh same look and feel

@android @Testing

Thera are two tipes of thesting in android: Unit testing and integration testing.

Unit testing divides in two, the local tests and the instrumentation testing. The local tests are the one that runs in the JVM, and doesn't need any resource from the android framework, or you can mock it easily. The other ones are the ones that runs on the device because they need resources from the android framework. to use this, we have to specify this in the gradle file: 

unit test, mockito is to mock the resources
dependencies {
    // Required -- JUnit 4 framework
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    // Optional -- Mockito framework
    testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.10.19'
}

this are the dependencies needed for the instrumented tests

android {
    defaultConfig {
        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
}

dependencies {
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:23.0.1'
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:runner:0.4.1'
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:rules:0.4.1'
    // Optional -- Hamcrest library
    androidTestCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library:1.3'
    // Optional -- UI testing with Espresso
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.1'
    // Optional -- UI testing with UI Automator
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.uiautomator:uiautomator-v18:2.1.1'
}

the integration test are made with the UI and it can be devided in two: the locals and the ones that interacts with oters app.

The locals UI tests are made using Espresso a framework test, it dependencie is decalred avobe. it allows preforming clikc and so in the UI app.
The second kind of tests are amde unsing the IU Automator, this is diferent taht espresso, becasu it can interact with the UI of others app using the UIautomatorviwer tool, we can acces this tool in the /home/carlos/Android/Sdk/tools, if we add it to the $PATH environmentvariable we can use it from eny other directory. it lounches a tool that can take an screenshot for the current app, and it give us the ides and we can perform actions or comapre the content value.

the harmcrest library is used with teh asetrions in all the mentioned tests, because it provide a sintaxis easier to reed and more flexible. for example teh asertion change like this: assertTaht(expected_value, is(real_value)) and we can negate simpli adding the not(), assertTaht(expected_value, not(is(real_value))) alik thsi we can creat a complex sentence and the negat it result.

@android @gradle @ADB @AVD

AVD and ADB sounds alike but they are totally diferent:
The AVD is the one that lets us cerat an emaulated device: Android Virtual Device
ADB(Android Bebug Bridge) is a command line tool, wich lets you communicate with an emulator instance or with the plugged device.  
Android uses gradle, a test manager, taht build the app into an APK, we can use the ADB to install the APK in the device and also we can run it from the command line, we can find this tool in the floder /home/carlos/Android/Sdk/platform-tools, if we add it to the $PATH variable we can us it from anywhere.

 Command Line Tool Commands
The usage of these commands is entirely optional. The result is that same as clicking the Run button in Android Studio.

chmod +x gradlew - This command only needs to be run once and is used to give gradlew the correct execute permissions.
./gradlew assembleDebug - This command will compile the code.
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk - This command will install the APK. With the -r flag it will overwrite any prior installed versions. Note if you have more than one device, you will need to use the -s flag right after adb to specify the serial number of the intended device.
adb shell am start -n com.example.android.sunshine.app/com.example.android.sunshine.app.MainActivity - This command will actually run the app.

@android @RecyclerView @adapter @ViewHolder

to display a list of objects in the screen, we could use a ScrollView to contain a groupview, and inside thsi we could place all teh items we need, but this aproach is expensive, all the obajects would be in memory, which is not good. the aproach we are looking for is the ona that can creat the objcts just in time wen we scroll and also can re use the created view. in this aproach we use a RecyclerView that is an improvement to the ListView, it is better with a larga dasa set. to use thiswe have flow this steps:

-Create anther layout wich will be the structure of the item in the list.

-use the RecyclerView view in the layout, to us this, we must place a dependencie in the build,gradele file:  compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.0.+'

-in the oncreate method (or in oncreateview in fragments) we have to get teh reference to the View mentiones above. using findViewById() we store that reference in a var type ReciclerView: RecyclerView mRecyclerV = findViewById(R.id.Id_of_the_view). Then we must set it the adapter and the layoutmanager: mRecyclerV.setLayoutManager() and mRecyclerV.setAdapter(New adapter(list data_set)). we can also set  mRecyclerV.setHasFixedSize(true); if we know that tha size on teh screen of the view wont shange with the elemnetos of the data set.

-To set the layoutAdapter we can use one already built: new LinearLayoutManager(getContext()); thear are also other type like grid and costume.

-To set the Adapter, is the triky part. an adapter is the intermediate between the data set and the view (in theis case the recyclerview) who displays the data. the adapter is a clas wich extends from RecyclerView.Adapter<ViewHolder> It is a generic and must use a clas that extends from RecyclerView.ViewHolder. It follows a design patter called ViewHolder design pattern. which means that it uses a clase that extends from RecyclerView.ViewHolder. usually it is an inner class. This class taht extends from viewHolder, is used to get the reference to the item and its childrens in the recylcer view, it gets the view in teh constructor. The outerclass, the one wich extends RecyclerView.Adapter must overide three methods, all of the used by the layoutmanager at sertain time, here is an snipet: 

   //it is used by the layout manager. simply create the object of the view holder
    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {

        View card = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_item_forecast,parent,false);

        return new ViewHolder(card);
    }

    //it is used byt the layout manager to replace the data
    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
        holder.mTextView.setText(mDataSet.get(position).getForecast());
        holder.mImageView.setImageResource(mDataSet.get(position).getImage());
    }

    //it is used by the layout manager
    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return mDataSet.size();
    }     

The last is used to know the number of elemnets of the data set. we get the dataset becuse in the constructor of teh adapter we recived it.
on createViewHolder, only creates the view, to do this we must call new viewHolder (the constructor of viewHolder) but it recives a view so, we must inflate this view befor calleing teh constructor, here we use the layout created for teh item on teh list. The onBindViewHolder is used to change the content of teh view item list, it get the viewholder view and teh positions, and we have acces to the attribs of that veiw becase we declared publics inthe viewholder, and use the position index to get the info for teh dat set and then set it to de correspond attribute.

and thast all.

@URI @URL @URN @WebService @RESTful @SOAP @API

First of all the web service is a way to intercat two diferents applications through internet, no matter the language it is bult with, nor the OS. it is devided in two: the big web service and the REST web services. The big one uses SOAP, this uses a lot of rules and standars, Simple Object Access Protocol.
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture like server-client, and the web services based in thisone are called RESTful. it is based in the HTTP requests, the idea is that the GET call alwas return an JSON or an XML. but you can also use post or delet or put, buet usually teh servers blocks thsi commands.

API stands for application programming interface, there are a lot of tipes of it, the SO supplies apis to make the software development smootly, also thera are apis provided vby sertain producers like samsung to intercat with the components. API provide a serie of buld bloch to use in the app and it gave us the correct way to comuncate other aplicatiosn (SO, drivers). But an special kind of apis are the WEB API or REST API, that are teh same that the restful web service, it returns an Json or XML.

Uniform Resource Identifier
URI
Uniform Resource Location
URL
Uniform Resource Name 
URN

are confuising but, the firsone conatins evritiong, it is wen we can identify the resource by anme and also we can say hoy to get it. the URN only provides the name of it
and teh URL only provides the way to gat the resource.

@android @DataBase

To store data in a DB we could use only an writtable instance of a db bunt is a good practice to write a content provider, this way we can shar data trough apps, and widgets and so.
first I will explain the things we need to write in the db without the content provider, and the i wil explayn the way of doing it with the content provider.

but firest, a content provider is a layer of absctarction used to conect the source of thata to the Ui or other app or a widget or so.

first we need a <<Contract CLass>>. this clas contains an inner class per every table of the db, in my exaple, two, evry class implements the BaseColumns interface, because this way we have the _ID column by defoult. In those innerclass we register the name of the table's columns like this:

 public static final String COLUMN_LOCATION_SETTING = "location_setting";


We need a <<DBHelper Class>> in my example we called it WeatherDbHelper an it extends SQLiteOpenHelper. we use this clas to build the database wen is udes for the first time. we define constructor like this   
    
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 2;

    static final String DATABASE_NAME = "weather.db";

    public WeatherDbHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

it gets the context and call the super constructor sending the context and also the name of the Db and teh version. this version is chnaged wen we refeactor the structure of the tables, it don't depends on the version of the app.

we overide the meothod onCreate(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase)
we use this method to build teh tables of teh DB. we define the query to build the table and the we use the recieibed parameter (an instance of the SQLiteDatabase) to buil the tables of teh DB with: 

sqLiteDatabase.execSQL(SQL_CREATE_LOCATION_TABLE);

the parameter is an String, we build that string using the name of teh columns defined in the Contract.

  
  final String SQL_CREATE_WEATHER_TABLE = "CREATE TABLE " + Contract.InnerClass.TABLE_NAME + " (" +
         
                Contract.InnerClass._ID + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT," +

                Contract.InnerClass.COLUMN_LOC_KEY + " INTEGER NOT NULL, " + ...

There is also a method of teh super clas called OnUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase, int oldVersion, int newVersion)
and it is called wen we change the version number of the DB declared in this class. if we add columns, we must alter the table if we want to preserv the dat, in my case I don't mind if the data is lost becaus I can retreive it form internet. so in this method i destroy teh tables and call teh method on create explicitly because the DB already exist so I wouldnt call bay itself.

if we use  

SQLiteDatabase db = new WeatherDbHelper(this.mContext).getWritableDatabase();

we get the writable instance and we can use it to insert or query the DB.

if we want to insert data to the DB we use 

db.insert(tablename, null, testValues)

we send 3 patrams to it, the table name, null and the data to store. this 3rd pram is a  ContentValue object.
a ConntentValue is a key-value structure, so we use te contract Class to get the name of te clumn as a Key and we use the vaue we want to insert aas a value in this structure.


 ContentValues testValues = new ContentValues();
        testValues.put(Contract.innerClass.COLUMN_LOCATION_SETTING, "SomeValue");

the insert returns an int, the Id of the row, if it returns -1 means something went wrong.

To query data from the db, we use again the writable instance and we call the method query()

db.query(
	WeatherContract.WeatherEntry.TABLE_NAME, //table name
	null,                                    // a projection they call, it is the name of teh lomuns we want, is an array of strings
	null,                                    // an Strig with the conditions without the value, but with a "?" instead. *
	null,                                    // an array of lues for the conditions *
	null,null,                               // i dont know 
	null);                                   // the order  

exaple * "ID = ? AND Date > ?"
       * new String[]{"2","30/12/2000"}

this method return a Cursor

A cursor is an object tat contains the data from a ror or several rows we can iterate through it. moveToFirst() it is used to select the first row and returns a boolean to know if it has or not taht first line. we can acces the value with 
Cursor.getString(indexOfColumn)
Cursor.getColumnIndex(StringOfColumnName).

after ll of this we must close the db and teh cursor to prevent memeory leaks.
db.close
cusrosr.close

Now If we use the content provider it is a little bit harder but it pays off


--------------------------------------//
//2016/07/06T10:20---------------------
@ContentProvider @ContentResolver

If we want to use a content provider we must use the content resolver, it is the one who resolve wich content provider are we going to use to fetch the data.
to make our Cotnet priovider we have to modify the COntract and Create a PrividerClass. this class extends ContentProvider.

We use URI's to accede the functionalities within the Provider class, in our contract, we will decalre the nesesary strings to buil the valids URI's, a URI have a scheme, an authority, and parameters. 

 public static final Uri CONTENT_URI = BASE_CONTENT_URI.buildUpon().appendPath(PATH_LOCATION).build();

CONTENT_URI is defined within the inner class, and we buildit using the uri and teh string declared in tne outer class.

there is a convencion, that the content provider must declare waht type of uri return every query function (an dir or just a single row) we declare in the inner class teh sting acording this two options.

   public static final String CONTENT_TYPE =
                ContentResolver.CURSOR_DIR_BASE_TYPE + "/" + CONTENT_AUTHORITY + "/" + PATH_LOCATION;
   
   public static final String CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE =
                ContentResolver.CURSOR_ITEM_BASE_TYPE + "/" + CONTENT_AUTHORITY + "/" + PATH_LOCATION;

and also we can declere functions to build uris or strings taht the provider will use.

To create the provider we just follow this steps: 

--define the URI's for the UI's for example, in sunshineAPP, we have the list and the detail, so we need a URI that make the Provider react to fetch a list of data (location) and other to fetch an specific data (day and location). and to insert and delete form the table (we have 2) we need a URI (so we need 2, one per table).

--define the int constnt to use in the switch statements

is easier if we use Ints insted of compare the urI everytime.

so we declare an int per valid URI 

  static final int WEATHER = 100;
  static final int WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION = 101;
  static final int WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE = 102;
  static final int LOCATION = 300;

To compare we need to use a UriMatcher, it is a class that works like a Regex.

 private static final UriMatcher sUriMatcher = buildUriMatcher();

the method buildMatcher is declared i the class.

within this method we instantiate the matcher and set it the valid uris

  	UriMatcher matcher = new UriMatcher(UriMatcher.NO_MATCH);

        // 2) Use the addURI function to match each of the types.  Use the constants from
        // WeatherContract to help define the types to the UriMatcher.
        matcher.addURI(WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY,WeatherContract.PATH_LOCATION,LOCATION);
	matcher.addURI(WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY,WeatherContract.PATH_WEATHER,WEATHER);
        matcher.addURI(WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY,WeatherContract.PATH_WEATHER+"/*",WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION);
        matcher.addURI(WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY,WeatherContract.PATH_WEATHER+"/*/#",WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE);

notice that in the method addUri we are using the constnats decalred in the cntract. the first param is the authority, fllowed by the name of the table(defined in the contract) concatenated with the requiered placeholder for the apropiate parameter in the URI, Imean if teh urI is scheme/authority/"param1"/344 it will match with the las URI


In the OnCreate we create an isntance to our DB helper, thsi way, we can get the instances to teh db and we can execute querys.

--add the constnts of the condition/Selection of the querys. 
private static final String sLocationSettingSelection = WeatherContract.LocationEntry.TABLE_NAME+ "." + WeatherContract.LocationEntry.COLUMN_LOCATION_SETTING + " = ? ";

notice that we are building it again using the contract constants (tabl name and the name of the column), we use ? tho indicate that te params in the value param eill replace this "?".\

--Last we implement the contentProvider overiding the methods:

	-getType()
	-query()
	-insert()
	-delete()
	-update()
	-bulkInsert()

this methods uses a swtch statemnt, within it uses the matcher declared at the biginig to get te INT of the URI and tis int is evaluated in teh switch.

example, within the query in the switch option:

case WEATHER: {
                retCursor = mOpenHelper.getReadableDatabase().query(
                        WeatherContract.WeatherEntry.TABLE_NAME,
                        projection,
                        selection,
                        selectionArgs,
                        null,
                        null,
                        sortOrder
                );
                break;

mOpenHlepr is teh instance cerated in te constructor

we defien adefult  default:
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unknown uri: " + uri);

in case the uri is invalid.

at last we must register the cursor to listen when the data related to de uri is change.
     
retCursor.setNotificationUri(getContext().getContentResolver(), uri);


in de insert or delete or udpate we call
 getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange(uri, null);
to notify all the child taht somethig has change.


The BulkInsert method is used when we need to insert an array of elements in a table and we don callll one by one the method insert


To us this CpntentProvidder, we call the content resolver like this:

	mContext.getContentResolver().methodToExecute();
example
	mContext.getContentResolver().bulkInsert(WeatherEntry.CONTENT_URI,cVVector.toArray(new ContentValues[cVVector.size()]));

@android @Loaders @CursorLoader

A loader is used wen we want to do the querying of some data in an asyinchronous way, it creates an async task to do the work there, but the task is not bind to the Activity or the fragment, so it doesent crash when the device is rotated, it is called ASYNC TASK LOADER.

we use this becaus if we wanted to make the query in the UI, it could take a long time and it could cause daly in the rendering. Also teh query would be attach to teh activity/fragment, and it would die with it.

There is a sub class called Cursor Loader, it is better tahn asynctask loader, because it is optimiced.

This loaders are made to monitor the underlaying data and uodate the UI if something in benith changes.

To implement a loander we have to implements the interface 

	-LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> (is a cursor loader)

in the fragment or activity

the methos provided by the interface are:

    @Override
    public Loader<Cursor> onCreateLoader(int id, Bundle args) {
        //because this is only calle once the location doesnt change so, it dont update to teh new one

        String locationSetting = Utility.getPreferredLocation(getActivity());
        String sortOrder = WeatherContract.WeatherEntry.COLUMN_DATE + " ASC";
        Uri weatherForLocationUri = WeatherContract.WeatherEntry.buildWeatherLocationWithStartDate(locationSetting, System.currentTimeMillis());

        CursorLoader loader = new CursorLoader(this.getActivity(),
                weatherForLocationUri,
                FORECAST_COLUMNS,
                null,
                null,
                sortOrder);

        return loader;
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoadFinished(Loader<Cursor> loader, Cursor data) {
        //When the loader has loaded some data (either initially, or the
        //datasource has changed and a new cursor is being provided),
        //Then we'll swap out the curser in our recyclerview's adapter
        // and we'll create the adapter if necessary
        if (mAdapter == null) {
            mAdapter = new ForecastAdapter(mDataList, getActivity());
        }

        mAdapter.swapCursor(data);
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoaderReset(Loader<Cursor> loader) {
        //If the loader is reset, we need to clear out the
        //current cursor from the adapter.
        mAdapter.swapCursor(null);
    }

in teh first method "onCreateLoader" we return a CursorLoader, that taques the same parameters than the query does.

to call this method we do it in the OnActivitycreated(in a fragemnt case), with 
	
	-getLoaderManager().initLoader(LOADER_ID, null, this);

the first param is an int, the second is an optional bundle, this is teh context.
the int id in unic for the loader. thsi way the Loader manager knows if it has beeen already initialize. becaus teh method "onCreateLoader" is called once.
thev"OnLoadFiniched" method is invoqued when there is a change in teh undelaying Content provider.
"onLoadReset" is called with 
	- getLoaderManager().restartLoader(LOADER_ID, null, this);
here we use the same Id because we want to update that loader with know params for the Query. this method calls the firstone to set the new data.

@android @Adapters @diferent_Layouts

this is very Easy, in a conventional adaper we have to veride two methods:


@Override
int getViewTypeCount(){}

@Override
int getItemViewType(int position){}

the first return 1, overriding we must place the number of layouts that our adapre suports. Im my case y returned 2.

the second is wher we must place de logic to return the id of the layout type,

for exple if teh position is == 0 (the first) we return 0 else 1, this ints can be decalred in yhe top like constants.

in the new view method we use the int returnd in the last method to inflate one layout or another.

using the recyclerView is slightly diferent, because the method getViewItemCount() does not exist. only the getItemViewType, it the same we put the logyc to return an int to idetify the layout. and in the onCreateViewHolder() method we use this int returned from the onItemViewType, it already get the int in teh params.

@Multiple_screen @Multiple_resources @qualifiers

Android scale the layouts and drawables to fit the sreen in which the app is runing, but it is good practice to provide an specific layout for different sizes and different drowables for specific densities.

the way android picks the resource depending on certain caracteristic like orientation, density, size, etc, is using quialifiers. To use qualifiers you have to add the resource in a separate folder following this pattern [resourcename]-[qualifier] for exapmle, to define diferent drowables for sertains dencities, yo must save the drawable in the folder: Drowable-hdpi, Drowable-xhdpi, Drowable-xxhdpi. to specify different layots is: layouts-large, layouts-small, layouts-xlagre. I will talk about this las part later in this entry.    

To create alternative bitmap drawables for different densities, you should follow the 3:4:6:8:12:16 scaling ratio between the six generalized densities. For example, if you have a bitmap drawable that's 48x48 pixels for medium-density screens, all the different sizes should be:

36x36 (0.75x) for low-density
48x48 (1.0x baseline) for medium-density
72x72 (1.5x) for high-density
96x96 (2.0x) for extra-high-density
144x144 (3.0x) for extra-extra-high-density
192x192 (4.0x) for extra-extra-extra-high-density (launcher icon only; see note above)

till android 3.something the standar to defin the size was like mentioned before using medion, large, xlagre etc. but nuw we shuld think in the design and define the size in minimum dps used by the design.
 
this is a table wiht the dp of some phones

Configuration examples
To help you target some of your designs for different types of devices, here are some numbers for typical screen widths:

320dp: a typical phone screen (240x320 ldpi, 320x480 mdpi, 480x800 hdpi, etc).
480dp: a tweener tablet like the Streak (480x800 mdpi).
600dp: a 7” tablet (600x1024 mdpi).
720dp: a 10” tablet (720x1280 mdpi, 800x1280 mdpi, etc).

now the folder wold be like this

layout-w320dp instead of layout-small

you can use w or ws, the first take teh width of teh device (depending of the orientation) the ws takes the smalles side of the divice (don't care about orientation)

this fits better with teh disgn and not depends on the device size.

@aliases @android @supporting_different_screens

When I was working on the sunshine App I faced a problem that I needed to display a laout if the device was in the portrait mode, one in the lanscapemode and one for the tablets, but the landscape mode and teh tabblets was teh same. One solution was to have the same file in the /res/layout-sw600dp and /res/layout-landscape but ther is a bette rsolution. I defined the layout-wide.xml (I named it wide because layout.xml is the file for the portrait mode) in the /res/layout and I created the /res/values-sw600dp and /res/vaules-landscape and inside of them I create the refs.xml (the name doesn't matter) and inside I wrote:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <item name="layout" type="layout">@layout/layout-wide</item>
</resources>

in name we put the same name that we would put if we would create the file inside the  /res/layout-[qualifier] (I mean without the -wide, because in te code we infalte layout not layout-wide) 

and that's it.
